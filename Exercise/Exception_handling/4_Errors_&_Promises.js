//Promises handle errors differently to synchronous or callback-driven code.

const p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    reject(new Error('Oops'));
});
// anything that is `reject`ed inside a promise will be available through catch
// while a promise is rejected, `.then` will not be called
p
    .then(() => {
        console.log("won't be called");
    })
    .catch(e => {
        console.log(e.message); // output: Oops
    })
    // once the error is caught, execution flow resumes
    .then(() => {
        console.log('hello!'); // output: hello!
    });

/*currently, errors thrown in a promise that are not caught results in the error being swallowed, which can make it
difficult to track down the error.*/
